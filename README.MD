# Final Project 

## Project Description
- The player will control a knight who will progress towards a castle facing enemy knights along the way. There will be three different attacks (overhead, slash, stab) and each for each different attack the player will have to react by matching the attack from the enemy. Enemy knights will have different stats such as more range or a faster attack speed to make the player adapt to different fighting styles. After reaching the castle the player will versus the king of the castle and upon defeating him will face endless enemies for a score at the end.
